    "Ans:- Files in Python can be opened with a built-in open() function. Ideally, it takes two string arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The file path including the file name and the extension we want to open, is to be passed as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The mode in which we want to open the file, to be passed as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the syntax for opening a file would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"\", \"\").\n",
    "Python has a wide range of file opening modes, these are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In ‘r’ mode, the file opens in the read mode. By default, if we don’t specify the mode argument, it will be treated as read or ‘r’ mode. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\") or open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "2. In the ‘w’ mode, the file opens in write mode. It removes existing content, if present, in the file. If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "3. In the ‘a’ mode, the file opens in append mode. It adds content to an existing file (or append at the end of the file). If the specified file doesn’t exist, it creates one with the specified name. It does not remove the existing content from the file. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘a’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "4. In the ‘r+’ mode, the file opens in the read & write mode. It does not remove existing content, if present, in the file and does not create a file if not present in the directory. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘r+‘ mode:\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r+\")\n",
    "5. In the ‘w+’ mode, open the file in the read & write mode & remove existing content. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. It does not remove existing content & if a file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in ‘w+’ mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w+\")\n",
    "6. In the ‘a+’ mode, the file opens in the read & append mode. It does not remove existing content & If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new one. For Example, To open our file myfile.txt in a+ mode:\n",
